# Stroke EDA, statistics and machine learning prediction 

In this repo you can see a full analysis of stroke prediction using Rmarkdown in Rstudio and Flexdashboard to make a dashboard. 

For the graphical analysis we make plots for the numerical and categorical variables. Also we make statistics test. 

We use Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting to the prediction.
