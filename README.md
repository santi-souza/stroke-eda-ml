# Stroke Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of stroke prediction using the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and machine learning predictions. The work is implemented in R, with RMarkdown for documentation and Flexdashboard for interactive visualization.
