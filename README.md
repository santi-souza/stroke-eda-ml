# Stroke EDA, statistics and machine learning prediction 

In this repository you can see a full analysis of stroke prediction using Rmarkdown in Rstudio and Flexdashboard to make a dashboard. 

There are 2 main codes, one for the full analysis and the other for the dashboard. 

For the graphical analysis we make plots for the numerical and categorical variables. Also we make statistics tests for all the variables. 

We use Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting to the prediction. 

You can see the dashboard in the next link (if you have any problem let me know): https://santisouza.shinyapps.io/DashboardTFM/ 

The dataset is in the repo, but if you want more info you can go to the next link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
